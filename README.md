# 🫂 Virtual Hug Card

A sweet, interactive web experience designed for **Hug Day** (or any day you want to send some love). 

This project features a playful interface where the user is asked for a hug. If they try to say "No", the button runs away (on desktop) or plays sad music (on mobile). When they say "Yes", happy music plays and they get to interact with a "Hug Meter" to send warmth!

## ✨ Features

- **🎭 Interactive Storyline:** Starts with a cute request. If rejected, it plays sad music; if accepted, it plays happy music.
- **🏃 Runaway Button:** On desktop, the "No" button physically runs away from the cursor so they *have* to click Yes!
- **🎵 Mood-Based Audio:** - `song1.mp3` triggers on rejection (Sad/Funny).
  - `song2.mp3` triggers on acceptance (Romantic/Happy).
- **🔋 Hug Meter:** A "Hold to Fill" interaction that simulates squeezing a hug tighter.
- **✨ Visual Effects:**
  - 3D Glassmorphism Card Tilt.
  - Emoji Cursor Trail (❤️✨).
  - Floating background particles.
  - Confetti explosion on completion.
- **📱 100% Responsive:** Works perfectly on Mobile and Desktop.
